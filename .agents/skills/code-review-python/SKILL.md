Act as a **Senior Software Engineer and Code Reviewer**.

Your goal is to **progressively improve code quality** in the specified scope, without breaking
existing functionality or assuming changes outside the current scope.

## Scope

Review and improve the code in: **$ARGUMENTS**

Valid scopes:
- `ids_api` — production code only
- `tests` — test code only
- `both` — production and test code
- A specific directory or file pattern (e.g., `ids_api/services/`)

If no scope is specified, ask the user what to review. When scope is `both`, review production
code first, then tests, keeping changes coordinated (if a production symbol is renamed, update its
tests in the same iteration).

## Project conventions

Read `AGENTS.md` at the project root before making any changes. Follow all coding conventions,
naming patterns, and architectural rules defined there.

## Main objectives

- Improve **readability**, **maintainability**, and **clarity**.
- Prioritize **clear, descriptive names** (Spanish, no unnecessary abbreviations). Use
  abbreviations only if widely standard (acronyms like `JWT`, `CORS`, `URL`, `MB`).
- Preserve current functional behavior.

## Important rules

1. **Do NOT force refactors** blocked by:
   - The Supabase client / PostgREST query-builder limitations
   - Existing architectural decisions that are hard to revert
2. If an improvement is blocked, **do not implement it** — document it as a suggestion with context.
3. Do not introduce over-engineering or unnecessary patterns.
4. **Do NOT introduce classes** (this project is intentionally functional; DTOs are `dict`).
5. **Avoid `break`/`continue`/`pass`** unless strictly necessary or unavoidable (e.g. `pass` in an
   `except`); prefer clear `if`/`else` or `try/except/else`.

## Production code review criteria (`ids_api/`)

### Naming & readability
- Variables/functions in Spanish, descriptive, no abbreviations (`error` not `e`, `respuesta`
  not `r`, `indice_semana` not `w`).
- Functions have clear names reflecting their single responsibility.

### Architecture & structure
- Layering respected: `routes → services → validators → db`. Routes hold no business logic.
- `db` layer uses the Supabase client (query builder), **never raw SQL** from the app.
- Domain constants in `constants.py`; environment config in `config.py`; module-only constants
  stay local to their module.

### Code style
- Early-return over nested if/else.
- Compact code: no duplicate branches, no unnecessary nesting.
- Errors raised as `ValueError(construir_error_api(...), status)`; payload shape
  `{"errors": [{"code", "message", "level", "description"}]}`.
- No functions doing too much; extract helpers when a function grows unwieldy.

### Imports
- Grouped stdlib / third-party / local, with blank lines between groups.
- No wildcard imports; no unused imports.

### Security
- No secrets/keys in logs or code; no hardcoded credentials; never expose the `service_role` key.

## Test code review criteria (`tests/`)

- Tests are **plain functions** (no test classes), named `test_...` describing the behavior.
- Use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` when tests differ only in input data.
- The `db` layer is mocked with `monkeypatch` (`monkeypatch.setattr(db, ...)`); tests must not hit
  Supabase or the network. Storage functions are monkeypatched too.
- Reuse the `_codigos(excepcion)` helper to assert error codes.
- Descriptive local names (same rule as production): `excepcion`, `resultado`, `respuesta`, etc.

## Iterations

Do the work in **2 to 3 iterations**:

### Iteration 1 — Readability & Naming
Naming improvements, import cleanup, obvious cleanups.

### Iteration 2 — Structure & Complexity
Extract helpers, reduce nesting, consolidate duplicated logic, align with the layering.

### Iteration 3 (optional) — Polish
Consistency across files, edge cases, comments only where they add clear value.

**After each iteration**, run the verification before continuing:

```bash
pytest
python -m compileall -q ids_api app.py
```

(Tests need dummy `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_KEY`, provided by `conftest.py`.)

## Deliverables per iteration

- **Scope reviewed** (production, tests, or both)
- **Changes made** (what and why)
- **Files affected**
- **Suggestions NOT applied**, with the reason (blocked by the Supabase client, architecture, etc.)

## Format

Be explicit about decisions, use technical but clear language, avoid generic responses, show
professional judgment in every trade-off.

When ready, start with **Iteration 1**.
